<h1>WIFIOUTLET</h1>
<p>


Popularity of home automation devices has increased greatly in recent years due to higher affordability and simplicity through smartphone connectivity.
In this project we will be developing the Smart Outlet a stand-alone communication unit, used to connect home outlets to the internet.
We could control simple appliances throughout the home, remotely , using wireless commands from the web.



These devices are intended for plug-and-play use, with no complicated setup required so consumers can install them into their own homes with minimal knowledge of home networking or electrical wiring.
Most of these devices function at any time and any location with Wi-Fi or cell service. They also come with dedicated smartphone apps, and all offer a manual override. With smartphones, users can receive notifications right to their phones. This provides a convenient way to check on the status of your home.
Portability.
